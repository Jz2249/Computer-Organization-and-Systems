ARIANE-5 CASE STUDY
1) The failure was caused by tring to staff a 64-bit number into a 16-bit space.It was not detected before because the programmers decided that the particular velocity figure 
would never be large enough to cause trouble. 
2)Since int is only 32 bit, it may cause overflow when adding two large integers together. I would simulate the whole process to check any bounded case that may cause overflow before the launch date.
