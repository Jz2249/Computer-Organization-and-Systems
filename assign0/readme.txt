INTRUDER DETECTION ACTIVITY
2a)The username is mattv. I use ls samples/server_files/home >ls.txt and cp sample/server_files/users.list users.list. By these two steps, I have two files which are ls.txt 
   and users.list. Then I use diff command to get the result.
2b) I use ls -a to find out the hidden file which is .bash_history. 
2c)I then use grep "sudo" .bash_history to extract the information. The commands are
sudo dmesg
sudo emacs /etc/passwd
sudo cp -r /etc /mnt/usb/etc
sudo su
