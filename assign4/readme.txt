DISCLOSURE AND PARTIALITY CASE STUDY
1) Mr. Kaminsky's first call was to Paul Vixie, a longtime steward of the internet's DNS system.
   Then the director of penetration testing at IOActive, a security firm based in Seattle, had developed a close working relationship with Microsoft. 
   He and Mr. Vixie persuaded Microsoft to host a secret convention of the world's senior cybersecurity experts.
   Given the context, I think he demonstrated in doing impartial benevolence.
2) In my opinion, impartial benevolence is appropriate for a government in deciding whether to disclose or stockpile vulnerabilities.
   Govenment should take responsibility of all citizens. When government chooses between disclose and stockpile vulnerabilities, they must
   evaluate the impact to all citizens instead of only considering specific group. As Santideva's argument advocate, government should consider
   the public and citizens suffering and feel like their own suffering, so that they can make the right decision to maximize public happiness. 
3) I will think partiality towards family members but not partiality towards one state over another. As a individual, I can't ignore my family 
   value. At the same time, I will not negatively impact the state. By doing this, I can protect my family lives and benefits whole state.
